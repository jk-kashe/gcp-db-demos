## Notes

* This repository does not host the demos themselves, only packages them for easier deployment.
See license of referenced repositories for licensing information.

* These scripts are not in any way supported by Google.

* These scripts are not meant to be run on a production environment or even be considered as
a source of best practices - on the contrary, as the objective is only to provide canned demos,
they are likely to contain bugs and anty-patterns.
